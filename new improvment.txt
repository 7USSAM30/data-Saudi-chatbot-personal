 What is a RAG Chatbot?
A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot is an AI assistant that:
Retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base (documents, web pages, databases, etc.) using semantic search (vector search).
Augments the user’s question with this retrieved context.
Generates a final answer using a large language model (LLM) like OpenAI GPT, Gemini, or Azure OpenAI.
This approach allows the chatbot to answer questions using up-to-date, domain-specific, or private data—not just what the LLM was trained on.
2. How Does Web Scraping Fit In?
Web scraping is the process of automatically collecting data from websites. In a RAG system, you use web scraping to:
Gather fresh, relevant information from the web (news, documentation, FAQs, etc.).
Periodically update your knowledge base so your chatbot always has the latest info.
3. What is a Vector Database?
A vector database stores text data as high-dimensional vectors (embeddings). This allows you to:
Search for the most semantically similar pieces of text to a user’s query.
Retrieve relevant context even if the user’s wording is different from your documents.
Popular vector DBs: Weaviate, Pinecone, Chroma, FAISS.
4. How Does the Whole System Work?
A. Data Collection (Web Scraping)
Use tools like Playwright or Selenium to scrape web pages.
Clean and preprocess the scraped text.
B. Indexing (Vector Database)
Split the text into chunks (paragraphs, sections, etc.).
Generate embeddings for each chunk using an embedding model (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.).
Store the chunks and their embeddings in a vector database.
C. Chatbot Query Flow
User asks a question.
Embed the question using the same embedding model.
Search the vector DB for the most similar chunks (context).
Combine the context and the question into a prompt.
Send the prompt to an LLM (like GPT-4, Gemini, etc.).
Return the LLM’s answer to the user.
